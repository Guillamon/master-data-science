## INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING CODE
The code has been developed and tested on a Windows 10 OS, so make sure you run it there
To get the code running, **install the following**:
1. **Anaconda**. You can download it [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
2. **R**
3. **RStudio** (make sure it is at least version 3.4.2)
4. This is accesory: you can install **Image Magick** for Windows to produce GIFs from charts. You can download it [here](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php)

For a detailed step by step of installation go [here](https://www.guru99.com/download-install-r-rstudio.html#8)

Now download or clone this repository on your local disk. 
From RStudio, open the RPROJ file master-data-science.proj. Always run the code from there to make sure paths to directories are correct.

When running the code **remember this**:
+ Pay special attention to running the script Install_Packages.R correctly.
+ Once you have opened the project, run the scripts in the order that is assigned to their file names
+ Make sure that *Data*, *Values*, and *Functions* that result from running each script are saved to the environment to move on to the next one
+ The scripts with suffix "week" overwrite saved *Data*, *Values* and *Functions* from the scripts with suffix "month"
